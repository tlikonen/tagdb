# Here you can edit records' content and tags. You must not edit the
# record id lines which look like:
#
# # Record: [...]  Created: [...]
#
# Such lines start a new record. You can edit the tag list that comes
# after the record id line. Tag lines have the prefix "#". Add more of
# such lines if you want. If you delete record's all tag lines the
# record's tags will not be modified. You must keep all #-prefixed
# header lines together (no empty lines between).
#
# After the header lines comes record's content. Empty lines at the
# beginning and end of the record content are ignored. If a record has
# empty content the record will be deleted from the database.
#
# To abort and cancel all changes save an empty buffer. You can also
# keep just those record's that you want to modify, and delete all
# others.

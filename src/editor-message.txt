# Here you can edit records' content and tags. You must not edit the
# record id lines which look like: "# Record: [...]  Created: [...]".
# You can edit the tag list that comes after the prefix "# Tags:".
# Add more of such lines if you want. You must keep all #-prefixed
# header lines together (no empty lines between).

# Empty lines at the beginning and end of the record content are
# ignored. If a record has empty content the record will be deleted from
# the database.

# To abort and cancel all changes save an empty buffer.

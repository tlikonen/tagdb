  The default operation prints all database records that match the given
  TAG(s). The TAG name arguments can be any substring of the actual tag
  names.

General options

  -v    Verbose output. Also print records’ timestamps.
  -q    Quiet output. Don’t print records’ metadata, just the content.

  --utc
        Print timestamps in UTC time instead of local time zone. This is
        relevant only with verbose (-v) output.

  --db=FILE
        Use FILE as the database file instead of the default. The
        program will try to create all the necessary directories for
        FILE. The default database location is defined by variable
        $XDG_DATA_HOME (default: “$HOME/.local/share”).

  --format=MODE
        Set output format to MODE which can be “text”, “text-color” or
        “org-mode”. You can add suffix “/default” to MODE in which case
        the specified mode will be saved as the default output mode.

Command options

  -s TAG ...
        Short output. This is like the default operation but only prints
        the first line of records’ content. The first line could be used
        as record’s title.

  -n TAG ...
        Count and print how many records match the given TAG(s).

  -c TAG ...
        Create a new database record associated with the given tags. If
        there seems to be data coming from the standard input it will be
        saved as the record’s content. Otherwise the default text editor
        is launched for editing the record. Empty lines at the beginning
        and end are ignored.

  -e TAG ...
        Find all records that match the given tags and launch the
        default text editor for editing the records’ contents and tags.
        Empty lines at the beginning and end of the record content are
        ignored. If a record has empty content the record will be
        deleted from the database.

  -l [TAG ...]
        List tags that match the given TAG name string(s). If no
        arguments are given list all tags.

  -r OLD NEW
        Reassociate records. All database records associated with the
        old tag will be associated with the new tag. The old tag is then
        removed.

  -h    Print this help text.

  --version
        Print program’s version and copyright information.
